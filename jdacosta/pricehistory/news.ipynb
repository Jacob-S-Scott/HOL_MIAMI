            "    SUMMARY: Opening Bid Unfiltered is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. Few have championed the need for people to invest in individual stocks like Jim Cramer. The former hedge fund manager essentially created the financial commentary world after leaving the hedge fund world. His goal since those early days: demystify the world of investing for the average investor. Cramer founded legendary business publication TheStreet.com in 1996 and went toe to toe with MarketWatch in the early 2000s to provide investing analysis to the growing masses interested in investing. He has been on TV consistently with his popular investing show, Mad Money, for over 20 years. Despite his many achievements, Cramer isn’t resting on his laurels. He is back with his 8th book on investing, How to Make Money in Any Market. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Cramer about his new book, which champions the need for people to buy stocks to build immense wealth. He also shares his views on some of the hottest stocks today, such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Oracle (ORCL). As a bonus, Cramer and Sozzi also reflect on their time working together at TheStreet, an institution in financial media where Sozzi got his start because of Cramer.

            "    Summary: Opening Bid Unfiltered is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. Few have championed the need for people to invest in individual stocks like Jim Cramer. The former hedge fund manager essentially created the financial commentary world after leaving the hedge fund world. His goal since those early days: demystify the world of investing for the average investor. Cramer founded legendary business publication TheStreet.com in 1996 and went toe to toe with MarketWatch in the early 2000s to provide investing analysis to the growing masses interested in investing. He has been on TV consistently with his popular investing show, Mad Money, for over 20 years. Despite his many achievements, Cramer isn’t resting on his laurels. He is back with his 8th book on investing, How to Make Money in Any Market. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Cramer about his new book, which champions the need for people to buy stocks to build immense wealth. He also shares his views on some of the hottest stocks today, such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Oracle (ORCL). As a bonus, Cramer and Sozzi also reflect on their time working together at TheStreet, an institution in financial media where Sozzi got his start because of Cramer.
